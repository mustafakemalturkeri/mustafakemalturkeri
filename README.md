Hi, I’m Mustafa Kemal Türkeri!

I am a civil engineer working in the fields of drought management, climate change resilience and GIS.

In my github repository, I will create some codes to analyze drought. Hopefully, they I will merge them into a very comprehensive drought toolbox in the future.
I will be using Python language mostly, however I may use some Matlab/Octave codes.

You can reach me anytime from mustafakemalturkeri@gmail.com.
